# 0x07 - Explain Compliance-based Assessments

Compliance-based assessments are designed to meet the requirements of a specific law or standard. In most scenarios, the organization must be tested and certified by an authorized agency against the defined compliance-based assessment. Not every organization needs to obtain a compliance-based certification or pass the assessments. Many organizations define their own security policies that they use to ensure their infrastructure security.

## Key Aspects of Compliance-based Assessments and their Limitations

There are various compliance-based assessments that are available. Compliance is assured through implementing various types of security controls, which can be administrative, technical, physical, and operational. Each type of assessment defines the criteria that must be passed for completing the assessment. Penetration testing can be used to validate security controls.
It is not necessary that every organization needs to opt for each of these assessments. Each one is designed with a specific purpose. Purpose of each assessment is as follows:

## Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard

### (PCI-DSS)

PCI-DSS assessment is applicable to organizations that deal with credit, debit, and cash card transactions. It is intended to protect the cardholders so that their personal information cannot be misused. It defines strict parameters for the organizations so that the cardholders’ information can be protected.

### Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

HIPAA applies to health care providers and organizations. It is designed to ensure the confidentiality of protected health information (PHI). HIPAA is divided into several major standards that are:

* Privacy Rule
* Security Rule
* Transactions and Code Sets (TCS) Rule
* Unique Identifiers Rule
* Breach Notification Rule
* Omnibus Final Rule
* HITECH Act

### SOX

In the United States, all public companies, financial and IT, must comply with the SOX assessments. It requires all business transactions to be saved for not less than five years. Even though it does not define how the information should be stored, but it defines which information must be stored.

### Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)

GLBA is also known as the Financial Modernization Act of 1999. It is applicable to financial organizations and mandates them to define and explain how the customer’s private information is protected and shared. This act also mandates the organizations to inform customers about sharing their personal information, provide the customer with the option to opt-out if he or she does not want their personal information to be shared with a third-party, and implement security controls to ensure that the customer’s information is secured.

### Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2

FIPS 140-2 is applicable to the hardware, software, and firmware solutions. Any of these that use cryptography must pass FIPS 140-2. This assessment is designed to ensure high security for the customers.

#### Limitations

Even though the compliance-based assessments are designed for a specific purpose, they do bring in certain limitations. These limitations are listed below:

* The compliance standard defines the rule and the guidelines to complete the assessment. The organization must adhere to the rules and guidelines if it needs to complete the assessment. For example, as per the compliance standard, you may have to conduct penetration testing on the internal and public-facing network.
* Data isolation is critical and should be separated from the rest of the network. The scope needs to only test the environment, excluding the data, such as the cardholder’s data.
* If using cryptography, then the FIPS 140-2 must be adhered to.
* Storage and network must be segregated and provide limited access during enetration testing.
* If adhering to more than one standard, then the operations and data must be segregated carefully. For example, if an organization is seeking compliance with PCI-DSS and HIPAA, then the operations and data must be segregated so that there is no overlap. Using this strategy, the organization can have one standard for one environment and the other one for the second environment.
* Each standard has its own requirements, and therefore, each one may require the organization to hire external consultants to meet them, hence, increasing the cost.
