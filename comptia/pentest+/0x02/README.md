# Explain Penetration Testing Resources and Requirements

The resources that should be made available to the pentester are dependent on the scope of penetration testing. There can be a variety of resources that can be made available to the pentester if they fit into the scope of penetration testing.

## Different Types of Resource Documents

Some of the key resource documents that a pentester will require are as follows:

### Web Services Description Language (WSDL) and Web Application Description Language (WADL)
The WSDL or WADL documents are XML documents that describe the SOAP-based or RESTful Web services. These documents are used to provide Web services over the Internet. For example, a client system can read the WSDL document to know the functions that are available on the server. WADL is considered to be lightweight and easy to define than WSDL. WADL provides an XML description of HTTP-based web services.

##' SOAP Project File

The SOAP project file provides information that can be useful in testing SOAP-based Web services. The developers can create the SOAP project file from the WSDL file.

### Software Development Kit (SDK) Documentation
There are open-source and commercial SDKs available in the market. However, an organization can also create a custom SDK to develop an application. The pentester should have access to the SDK documentation to perform a test on the applications.

### Swagger Document

The Swagger document provides information about the REST API and how it works. This information can be useful to the pentester as to how the API can be tested.

###XML Schema Definition (XSD) file

The XSD document defines the XML elements and their attributes that appear in an XML document. This document also defines the relationship between the elements and the data that will be stored within them.

## Budget Requirements

Budgeting makes a great deal of impact on the scope of penetration testing. Both the parties involved, the service provider and the recipient, must come to an agreement to define the scope of the services in a defined budget. The service recipient will want to minimize the cost but increase the scope of the penetration testing. On the other side, the service provider will want to maximize the revenue and decrease the effort. In some cases, the scope of penetration testing may be reduced if an appropriate budget is not available.

The budget could also be defined in a number of hours for the internal teams, which would need the allocation of time to conduct penetration testing. However, when an external team estimates the price, it would be dependent on the team size, the number of hours, scope of work, and so on. Depending on the budget available with the recipient party, the number of hours and team size could be increased or decreased. The scope of work needs to be mutually agreed between both parties.

## Technical Constraints

Penetration testing may be prone to technical constraints, which could be one or many. The technical constraints must be mentioned in the penetration testing plan so that the pentester is aware of them. Each organization would have different types of technical constraints. The pentester must carefully examine each one of them and come in agreement with the client.

The technical constraints can also be driven by the budget. For example, the commercial software that you require for penetration testing is too expensive for a single penetration test. Another example could be performing a test on a live Web server, which could impact the server performance.

Another example of technical constraints can include an old server that may not be able to handle penetration testing.
