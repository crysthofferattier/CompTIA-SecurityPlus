# 0x05 - Explain Target Selection and Threat Actors
Penetration testing needs to have focused targets. This helps in limiting the scope of the testing.

## Types of Targets

When defining the scope of penetration testing, you need to consider the types of targets that need to be involved. There are multiple types of target, which are as follows:

### Internal

The internal targets are located within the organization. An insider attack is common on the internal targets. An external malicious attacker can gain access to the internal target using social engineering or phishing attacks. The external attacker only needs access to the internal network, and then using methods like privilege escalation can cause damage to the internal systems.

### On-site

The on-site target is where the attack is being conducted. However, depending on the number of security controls implemented, the attacks can be prevented on the on-site targets. If the site is large enough, then there can be various entry points for the attacker to gain access to the targets.

### Off-site

The off-site target is not located within the organization premises to which it provides services. For example, the targets may be located at a branch office or a remote office that is linked with the head office using remote connectivity. If there are not enough security controls at the remote offices, then they may be the medium for a backdoor into the head office.

### External

The external targets are not present within the organization and are located on the Internet. The examples of external targets could be a Website or Web application.

### First-party hosted

First-party targets are hosted within the organization and can be an easy target. One of the common attacks could be zero-day vulnerability exploitation. A zero-day attack exploits an unknown vulnerability. Third-party targets can be difficult to penetrate, specifically if they are with a large organization, which can have multiple layers of security controls. Smaller organizations’ targets can be easy to penetrate.

### Third-party hosted

Third-party targets are either hosted at a vendor site or by a partner organization. Third-party targets can be difficult to penetrate, specifically if they are with a large organization, which can have multiple layers of security controls. Smaller organizations’ targets can be easy to penetrate.

### Physical

The pentester can test out physical security. One of the easiest methods can be piggybacking or shoulder surfing. Both are easy to perform. Piggybacking is a method in which the first person authorizes himself to enter a restricted area, and the second person enters the door quickly without authorization. In the shoulder surfing method, one person overlooks the shoulders of another person to read through the information on the mobile or a system.
Keyloggers are another thing that should be checked. Keyloggers capture the keystrokes and send them to a remote entity who controls the keylogger.

### Users

The pentester can also target the users as they are the easiest target. The pentester can use the social engineering method. Many users are likely to be the victim of a social engineering attack.

### SSIDs

A wireless network is accessed using an SSID, which is the name of the wireless network. An SSID may be visible or hidden. However, the pentester can use tools like Kismet to find hidden SSIDs. When an SSID of the wireless network is known, the pentester can attempt to connect to the wireless network. The pentester, in the simplest means, can capture the wireless traffic and find the SSID of the wireless network and MAC address of the access point. Various types of wireless attacks can be performed by the pentester. One such attack is cloning the access point using a tool named airbase-ng.

### Applications

Applications can be a primary target for penetration testing. Several Web applications have E-commerce capabilities, which must be tested and secured appropriately if vulnerabilities are found. Even if the Web application does not have E-commerce capability but runs the user context, then it is a good target to penetrate and perform remote code execution.

## Types of Threat Actors

Threat actors are any entity behind a threat, which is a potential danger to an asset. A threat actor can be largely categorized into three categories:

* Internal Threat (e.g., a rogue employee)
* External Threat (e.g., a criminal gang)
* Natural Threat (e.g., hurricane or tsunami)

Threat actors look for vulnerabilities, which are weaknesses that can be exploited. When a vulnerability is present in the network, server, or application, there is a risk that the threat actor may exploit it.

### Hackers

Hackers can come in different disguises. There are three types: black hat, gray hat, and white hat. Black Hat Hackers break into systems with malicious intent. They are usually either hired or contracted by organizations to evaluate their security parameters. The grey hat hackers are a combination of white hat and black hat hackers. They break into systems without seeking permission. They want to demonstrate their skills, but their intentions are not malicious, such as stealing valuable information or destroying data. Their actions are considered to be illegal because they do not seek permission to perform their actions.

### Script Kiddies

A script kiddie is someone who does not have the expertise of a hacker but relies on ready-made tools as they cannot write their own code. Due to a lack of expertise, their attacks are not sophisticated.

### Hacktivists

Hacktivists are threat actors who are hackers with a specific mission, which could be political or social. They are not after the money but have a cause that needs to be fulfilled. One of the most common attacks they use is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). They are determined to fulfill their cause and can work in groups with like-minded hackers.

### Nation States/State Sponsored

These threat actors are well-funded and well-organized cyber espionage entities that commit their activities with the backing of governments or similar large entities. State-sponsored attackers typically focus on infiltrating larger organizations with the intent to steal massive amounts of mission-critical and other sensitive data.

### Insider Threats

These threat actors are internal to an organization and can carry out a malicious activity intentionally or unintentionally. Some of the activities they perform are handing out confidential or sensitive information to others unintentionally or selling the information to another threat actor who wants to misuse the information.

It is very difficult to detect an insider threat as the person is part of the system. He would have access to the data along with the knowledge of internal operations and processes. Since they are inside the network, their actions are difficult to track by tools like a firewall.
