# 0x01 - Explain Penetration Testing and its Importance

Penetration testing (Pen test) is a simulated cyber-attack to exploit the vulnerabilities in a network and its systems. A person conducting the pentest can attempt to breach applications, protocols, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), servers, firewalls, and anything that can be exploited on a network.

The core intent is to discover the vulnerabilities before an attacker from the outside world can and then exploit them to simulate the amount of damage that can be caused.

## What is Penetration Testing?

Penetration testing is performed to discover the hidden vulnerabilities and then exploit them. Often the term vulnerability assessment and penetration testing are used interchangeably. However, both are not the same. Vulnerability assessment is part of penetration testing. As stated earlier, penetration testing first discovers the hidden vulnerabilities, which is vulnerability assessment.

As part of the vulnerability assessment, a pentester would find the hidden vulnerabilities and document them accordingly. The vulnerabilities are then fixed to ensure that they cannot be exploited.

Once the vulnerabilities are found, penetration testing goes one step further and exploits these vulnerabilities. The intent is to simulate an attack as an actual attacker would perform.

## The PenTest Process
There are several standards or frameworks that are available for penetration testing. Most common ones are:

* CHECK framework

* Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)

* Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM)

* Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)

* NIST SP 800-115

## Determine the Audience Type
The end result of penetration testing is the penetration testing report, which can have a diverse set of audiences. The scope of penetration testing will largely define the audience type.

Some of the key audience can be:

Senior management
* IT managers
* Security teams
* Web developers
* Web server administrators

The audience may vary depending on the test required. For example, if you are performing a penetration testing on the network, then the network administrators and the network team will likely be in the audience type.

If you are not performing penetration testing on a web application, web developers and web server administrators are not required to be part of the audience.
