# 0x04 - Explain Different Testing Strategies

There are different types of penetration testing strategies. They are black box, white box, and grey box penetration testing.

## Difference between Black box vs. White box vs. Gray box

After the scope of penetration testing is defined, it needs to be decided on the type of penetration testing to be performed. There are essentially three types of penetration testing:
* Black box
* White box
* Gray box

### Black Box

A black box test is also known as Zero Knowledge penetration testing. In the black box, the pentester does not have any information about the network except for an IP range. The pentester is typically an external entity who needs to exploit the network or systems to the fullest. The pentester is expected to gather information on his own, discover vulnerabilities, and then exploit them. A black box penetration testing takes more time as the pentester does not know anything about the network. However, it is more realistic because the pentester can provide an accurate assessment of the security of the network.

### White Box

The white box penetration testing is the complete opposite of a black box. It is also known as Full Knowledge Penetration Testing. The pentester will have all the information that is required to perform penetration testing. For example, the pentester will have the following information:

* Network diagrams
* List of systems with their IP address
* IP ranges
* User credentials to log on to the systems

The white box penetration testing takes less time than the black box testing because the pentester has the required information, to begin with. However, it may not provide accurate results as it does not visualize the attacks as an external attacker would.

### Gray Box

The gray box testing is a combination of the black box and white box. The pentester has limited information, to begin with, but generally does not have user credentials or the configuration details. For example, you may share the application name and its IP address with the pentester but not provide the application version or the services that it is running.
