# 0x06 - Explain Asset Categorization and Risk Assessment

Assets are critical for an organization. Depending on the type of asset, it will have certain risks associated with it.

## Types of Assets

Before understanding the types of assets, it is important to understand what an asset is. It is anything that has value to an organization. It could be servers, software, devices, the information in any format, services, people, or even intangibles, such as reputation or brand.

The assets typically have owners and custodians. The owner performs the asset management and is responsible for handling, disclosure, and destruction of the asset. He decides the need-to-know purpose for the asset.

The custodian, on the other hand, is responsible for protecting the data as per security requirements. The custodian provides accessibility of the asset to end-users. He is also responsible for quality assurance and data validation of the asset.

Types of assets in an organization are:
* People: Includes employees, customers, and partners
* Hardware: Includes servers, desktops, laptops, and any devices that are being owned by the organization
* Software: Includes operating systems and applications that are used for business purposes
* Data: Includes business and employee information
* Physical environment: Includes the physical infrastructure, which includes the business premises
* Processes: Includes the processes and procedures that enable an organization to run its business
* Third-parties: Includes partners

### Asset Inventories

Asset inventories are critical when figuring out what to protect and how much to spend protecting it. Asset inventories should be checked periodically to verify accuracy. Inventories should track details necessary for the following reasons:

* Asset identification
* Date of acquisition
* Security Classification
* Descriptive details
* Asset Location
* Information necessary for backup and restore, disaster recovery
* Asset owner and custodial information

## Different Types of Risk Responses

There can be four types of risk responses, namely:
* Risk reduction - Controls are used to reduce the likelihood/impact of the risk or minimize loss.
* Risk avoidance - Removing the threat by using alternate behavior to end the exposure.
* Risk transfer - Pass risk onto 3rd party such as an insurance company.
* Risk retention/acceptance - accepting the risk outcome as necessary to continuing the business goals and confirming monetary funds are available if required.
The controls are classified as Directive, deterrent, preventive, compensating, detective, corrective, recovery. Example of which include:
* Technical controls - Authentication, access control, encryption, etc.
* Procedural controls - Security awareness, training, etc.
* Physical controls - Fences, doors, fire suppression, etc.
* Legal, regulatory and compliance - Security policies, regulations, etc.

## Tolerance to Impact

Penetration Testing is likely to impact network performance. When conducting penetration testing, one must ensure that the servers or network devices are able to continue with their normal business operations without being impacted. Therefore, it is critical for the organization to identify the network devices and servers that are in scope or out of scope.

For example, an internally hosted live Web server can be brought down during penetration testing. It will impact its availability to the public that is accessing the Website hosted on the Web server. Therefore, the organizations, when defining the scope of penetration testing, must clearly understand the risk tolerance levels. For example, to ensure that the users are not impacted, the organization may decide to conduct the test at night or on the weekend. It will not increase the risk tolerance level for the Web server.

## Risk Appetite

Risk appetite refers to the number of risks that an organization can tolerate. It is the acceptance of the risks by the organizations keeping in mind the business objectives. The tolerance of risks should be weighed with the cost of closing the risk. If the cost of closing the risk is more than the risk itself, then the organization can choose to tolerate the risk.
